# 49er-shops-bookstore

This project is built using NodeJS / Express JS. It uses MongoDB as the database and stores the data of the application in the fully-managed cloud database named MongoDB Atlas.

This bookstore application manages the books or textbooks of CSULB and stores the information regarding textbooks needed by the students in MongoDB Atlas. The students can search the textbooks on the basis of the author. They can also buy the book as well as donate the books to the university bookstore. Futhermore, students can view all the books belonging to a particular author. 

More functionalities like renting textbooks for a particular duration as well as other school/university supplies like technology, faculty resources, graduation, clothing, etc will be added to the project in the future.
